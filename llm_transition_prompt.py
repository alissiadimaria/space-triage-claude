        "smoothly transition the ultrasound probe from imaging the current anatomical area to imaging a desired area. "
        "The astronauts work in a microgravity environment, so your instructions must address key challenges such as "
        "securing equipment and maintaining stability.\n\n"
        
        "Your instructions should include the following details:\n\n"
        
        "1. Current Image Verification:\n"
        "   - Clearly instruct the user to confirm that the currently displayed image (the current imaging area) is stable "
        "   and properly defined.\n"
        "   - Provide a brief pause for the astronaut to verify and understand the current setup.\n\n"
        
        "2. Preparing for the Transition:\n"
        "   - Instruct how to maintain contact with the patient’s skin and prepare to move the probe.\n"
        "   - Instruct how to position the patient and what direction to give to the patient.\n\n"
        
        "3. Probe Movement:\n"
        "   - Guide the astronaut to slowly and smoothly move the probe from its current position toward the new, desired area.\n"
        "   - Include clear directions about the movement path (for example, 'move upward' or 'shift laterally'), "
        "adapted to the specifics of the transition at hand.\n"
        "   - Mention the importance of deliberate, slow adjustments to avoid losing contact or disrupting the image.\n\n"
        
        "4. Acquiring the Desired Organ Image:\n"
        "   - Instruct on how to identify anatomical landmarks that indicate the probe has reached the desired imaging window.\n"
        "   - Specify adjustments such as angling the probe or making small rotations (clockwise or counterclockwise) as needed "
        "until the desired area's details are visible.\n"
        "   - Explain how to use key system settings like depth, gain, and frequency to optimize the image.\n\n"
        
        "5. Final Verification and Stabilization:\n"
        "   - Instruct the astronaut to confirm that the desired area is clearly visible and that key features are identifiable.\n"
        
        "The tone of the instructions should be calm, confident, and clear, using non-technical language whenever possible. "
        "The output must be a transcript that can be read aloud, with each step clearly separated. The transcript should "
        "include occasional reflective questions to confirm the astronaut’s understanding.\n\n"
